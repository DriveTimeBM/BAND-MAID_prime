## 🧩 What It Does

This userscript automatically adds an overlay on applicable BAND-MAID PRIME videos showing:

- 🎸 **Okyuji setlist** — song names (or content descriptions) and their timestamps  
- 🗓️ **Tour, venue, and date** information  
- 🔗 **Next / Previous part navigation** for multi-part Okyuji videos  
- 💬 Contextual notes (e.g., “Part 2 of 3 from the Zepp Tokyo performance”)  

The overlay updates dynamically when switching between videos — no page reload required. The overlay goes away in full screen mode.

## 🧠 Notes

Timestamp links are compatible with HTML5 players, but the Uliza player used on BAND-MAID PRIME ignores them.
They’re displayed for reference only and don’t interfere with playback.

The overlay automatically updates when navigating between video parts.

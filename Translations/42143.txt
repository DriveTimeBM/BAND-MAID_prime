🎥 Kanami’s Room – Talking About Saiki

Kanami:
How are you doing, Masters and Princesses?
This is Kanamincho. 🌸

The first episode of Maid’s Room was the one where I made coffee. ☕
The second one was where I just ate banana cake — basically me saying,
“I really love sweets!” (laughs)

And now, this is the third episode!

I thought a lot about what to do this time…
and I realized that one of my “hobbies” —
or maybe something beyond that —
is actually this person.

Let me show you a picture.

Here she is… can you see it?
It’s Sai-chan! 💖

At this point, I’m not even sure if “I like Saiki” is the right way to say it.
I might actually just be a fan. (laughs)
No, really — I think liking Sai-chan might be one of my hobbies!

So today, here in my room,
I’d like to talk a little bit about Sai-chan.

🎤 About Sai-chan

Here’s another photo —
this is Sai-chan during an Okyuji (concert).

When Sai-chan is performing,
she has this incredible energy that draws people in.
She’s such a powerful vocalist,
with amazing singing and performance skills.

Outside of Okyuji, though,
she’s still strong and dependable —
a real leader with a cool head and a sharp sense of direction.

But what many people might not know
is that she’s also really kind.

She has such a gentle side.
She’s always kind to Mincho. (laughs)
Yes… she’s so kind to me.
I love her. 💕

🫖 The “Yakan-kun” Story

Now, this picture here—look at this one!
Isn’t it cute?

So, I really love Cojicoji,
and I’d been saying that I wanted this “Yakan-kun” (Kettle-kun) plushie
that you can win from a UFO catcher (crane game).

And then, all of a sudden,
I got a LINE message from Sai-chan that said,
“I got it!”

I was like, “Wait, what? How?!”

Apparently, during some downtime between things,
she’d gone into a game center,
spent her own time and effort,
and won that Yakan-kun plushie for me.

When I heard that, I was just like—
“Sai-chan is so kind… I love her!” 😭💕

It’s such a cute picture, right?
I’m looking at it on my computer now…
Ah, it’s so cute.
That mouth—so cute! (laughs softly)

🎁 The Hug Dog Story

And this next photo—
this one’s from my birthday a few years ago.

For my birthday, Sai-chan gave me this present called “Hug Dog.”
It’s literally a stuffed dog that hugs you.

This picture was taken the first time I used it.

That gift was so touching.
Even now, when I think back on it, I get teary-eyed.

I bet some of the Masters and Princesses who saw it back then
might’ve shed a few tears too…
No? No one? (laughs)
Okay, maybe not. Sorry. (laughs softly)

💐 Final Thoughts

Sai-chan is often seen as cool,
or maybe even a little intimidating —
some people might think she’s scary.

But in truth,
she’s incredibly kind, strong, and sincere —
someone with a solid core.

She’s cool and caring,
and she’s the kind of person that everyone can’t help but love.

I’d love to keep talking about her forever,
but it seems I’m out of time for today.

Thank you so much for listening to me ramble about my beloved Sai-chan.

That’s all for today.
Bye-bye! 👋💗

📝 Fan Notes

Cojicoji & Yakan-kun: Cojicoji is a classic Japanese manga/anime by Momoko Sakura (creator of Chibi Maruko-chan). “Yakan-kun” is a minor character shaped like a kettle — Kanami’s favorite!

Hug Dog: A stuffed toy that wraps its arms around you — an adorable and heartfelt gift from Saiki.

Tone: Quietly giddy, affectionate, deeply genuine. Kanami’s “fan of Sai-chan” side is both humorous and touching.

Emotion: Though calm, her admiration is clear — she speaks about Saiki with sincere warmth and a little awe.
